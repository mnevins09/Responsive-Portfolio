				<h2>About Me</h2><br>

				<img src="assets/images/Matt.jpg" alt="profilePicture" id="image">
				<p> 
				I am orginally from New York.  I moved to St Simons Island, GA, 7 years ago.  I am married with a 14 month old boy and two dogs.  I graduated from Manhattan College in 2008 and earned a Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Administration.      
				</p>
				<p>
				While at Manhattan College, I was a member of the Division I baseball team.  In 2006, we were the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC) champions and advanced to the regional finals in Nebraska.  During regionals, we defeated the University of Nebraska and the University of San Francisco, which were the #9 and #25 teams in the nation at the time.  We were eventually defeated twice by the #13 Miami Hurricanes.  We were 3 wins away from advancing to the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. 
				</p>
				<p>
				My work experience includes 4 years in the banking industry, 4 years in accounting for the State of Georgia, and 3 years working for a software company, Systems and Methods, Inc.  I currently work from home and look forward to continuing my telecommute position with plans on becoming a developer within my current company.
